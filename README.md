# Projekt 8 - PDP2020
This repository contains a lot of stuff, most of it is us trying to learn how to build react native applications.

The project which this repository supports relates to the formation of long term habits.
The idea is that a physical device is better than an application as it can be placed in the context where the habit is to be learned. This allows a user to over time associate the context with the habit which means they grow away from our system and become independent.

There is a physical habit interface which is rendered on a raspberry pi. The physical habit interface is configured via a smartphone interface and both are written with react native code. The communication is configured with mySQL and a server which also serves the website for the raspberry pi.

There is also an app because why not and also configuration should not be made on the device.
The device can turn clockwise and counterclockwise and be pushed.
